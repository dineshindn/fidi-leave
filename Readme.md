# üôè Contribution guidelines

- Create branches from the `main` branch and name it in accordance to **conventional commits** [here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), or follow the examples bellow:


- test: :ring: Adding missing tests
- feat: :guitar: A new feature
- fix: :bug: A bug fix
- chore: :robot: Build process or auxiliary tool changes
- docs: :pencil2: Documentation only changes
- refactor: :bulb: A code change that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature
- style: :lipstick: Markup, white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons...


- The following example, demonstrates how to branch-out from `main`, creating a `test/a-test-scenario` branch and commit two changes!


- git checkout main

- git checkout -b test/a-test-scenario

- git commit -m 'test: verified X equals Z when Foobar'

- git commit -m 'refactor: input value changes'


- Here's an example of a refactor of an hypotetical `address-panel`:


- git checkout main

- git checkout -b refactor/address-panel

- git commit -m 'fix: font-size used in the address description'

- git commit -m 'refactor: simplified markup for the address panel'
